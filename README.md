# RUSTMapper

White pine blister rust (WPBR) is one of North America's most damaging tree pandemics. Aggregating data across the western U.S. from independent studies from 1995 -2020, we estimate WPBR risk for high-elevation five-needle pine species (High-5) from 1980 - 2023 in the adaptive management tool “RustMapper.”
