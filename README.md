# RUSTMapper

White pine blister rust (WPBR) is one of North America's most damaging tree epidemics. Aggregating data from more than 80 independent studies across the western U.S. from 1995-2024, we estimate WPBR risk for high-elevation five-needle pine species (High-5) from 1980 - 2023 in the adaptive management tool RustMapper. WPBR risk is the probability of observing WPBR on the High-5. Stream density, topography, hardiness zone, precipitation, air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and relative humidity were critical in estimating WPBR risk.
